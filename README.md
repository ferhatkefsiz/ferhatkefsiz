## Ferhat Kefsiz

I’m *software developer* passionate about **crafting accessible**, **pixel-perfect** user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with **robust engineering**. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development, creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.

In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings — from growing start-ups to independent consulting.

Outside of work, I’m usually swimming, reading, hanging out with my friends, or exercising.
